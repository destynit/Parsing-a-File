Assignment Information:
	Assignment #3, Parsing a File
Filename: 
	README.txt
File manifest:
	exp.c
	ex.txt
Compile Instructions: 
	make
Operating Instructions: 
	./a.out
Design Decisions:
	*Import a file and parse through each character
	*Ensure that the equation given follows the correct orders/parameters 

Extra Features:
	*None that I am aware of

Known Deficiencies/Bugs: 
	*Could not get the algorithm to print out 'Good' for the last equation under the good category from the example text
	*Could not get the algorithm to print out 'Bad' for the last equation under the bad category from the example text

Lessons Learned: 
	*I learned how to parse through a file, character by character. I learned how to utilize multiple call methods to essentially create loops and that it is okay to create multiple methods. I learned how to spot erroneous operands and output the proper error, likewise with equations that are considered good. Overall, I had a fun time learning this assignment.
